Game playing using Minimax Algorithm .
In this code we have , tic-tac-toe game which is very simple and famous.
Here we have applied the Min Max Algorithm which plays the role of bot 
and we are playing versus that bot .
The Min-Max algorithm is a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence and game theory, often used in decision-making processes, especially in games like chess, tic-tac-toe, and more. It is a simple yet powerful algorithm for determining the best move for a player in a two-player, zero-sum game.


We can also make this code a two player game by simply removing the Min-Max Algorithm and some other few changes.Code for that is also provided.
